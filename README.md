## About Security Headers Validator

Security Headers Validator is a Python tool designed to detect missing security headers and use of deprecated headers, based on the OWASP Secure Headers Project. 
It provides a simple way to identify potential security risks associated with the headers sent by web servers.

Security Headers Validator detects:
 - Missing security headers
 - Use of deprecated security headers
 - Use of recommended security headers

Security Headers Validator is written to be modular and hackable, you can easily add your custom headers and it's best practices.

## Usage

Short Form    | Long Form | Description
------------- |-----------|-------------
-t            | --target  | target url eg. https://example_site.com
-h            | --help    | show the help message and exit


* Specify target with -t variable. Provide the full url as below.

`python scanner.py -t https://example_site.com`

## How do I add a new header?

By following steps below you can add and integrate your headers to Security Headers Validator.

1 - Navigate to headers folder and create the <header_name>.py file eg. user_agent.py

2 - Copy the contents of template_header.py into your header file.

3 - Modify your header file as needed.

4 - Find the list variable "header_files" in the header_compiler.py

5 - Append the file name to header_files eg.   
    ```
    header_files = ["x_content_type_options.py", "user_agent.py"]
    ```

Optinal: Test your headers. Append the file name to header_files in test_headers.py. 
Run the test_headers.py to ensure that your header file works correctly. 
    ```
    pytest test_headers.py
    ```

#### Warnings
Header file names should not contain dashes. Instead use underscore. This is to prevent import errors.

Correct: user_agent.py
Incorrect: user-agent.py


## Unit-test

* Requires pytest

Navigate to projects directory and run the command below to test if your
headers work.

`pytest tests/test_headers.py`

## Planned Future Improvements

- [ ] List argument to scan a url list.
- [ ] Detect information disclosures in headers
- [ ] Detect weak CSP configurations.
